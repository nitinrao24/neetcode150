# leetcode 72
# Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.
# You have the following three operations permitted on a word:
# Insert a character
# Delete a character
# Replace a character

# Time Complexity:
# Space Complexity:

def minDistance(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
    # memo will store results of subproblems to avoid recomputing them

        Compute the minimum number of edits to convert
        the first i characters of word1 into the first j characters of word2.
        """

        # If we have already solved this subproblem, return the stored answer
        if (i, j) in memo:
            return memo[(i, j)]

        # If word1 is empty (i == 0), we need j insertions to build word2
        if i == 0:
