# leetcode 141
# Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.
# There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again
# by continuously following the next pointer.
# Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to.
# Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.
# Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.

# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space Complexity: O(1)
