# leetcode 286
# You are given a mÃ—n 2D grid initialized with these three possible values:
# -1 - A water cell that can not be traversed.
# 0 - A treasure chest.
# INF - A land cell that can be traversed. We use the integer 2^31 - 1 = 2147483647 to represent INF.
# Fill each land cell with the distance to its nearest treasure chest.
# If a land cell cannot reach a treasure chest then the value should remain INF.
