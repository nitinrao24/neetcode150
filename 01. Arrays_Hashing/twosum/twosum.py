# leetcode 1
# Given an array of integers nums and an integer target,
# return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
# You can return the answer in any order.

# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space Complexity: O(n)
